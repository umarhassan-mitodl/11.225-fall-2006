### Assignment 5

Read the following articles:

*   Pollan, Michael. "Playing God in the Garden." _The New Yorker_, 2002.
*   Borlaug, Norman. "We Need Biotech to Feed the World." _The Wall Street Journal._ (December 6, 2000).
*   Hopkin, Karen. "The Risks on the Table." _Scientific American._ (April 2001).

Summarize and evaluate the case of genetically modified food.

Read the literature provided on genetically modified foods. What holes can you find? What questions remain unanswered for you? What do you agree with or disagree with in the literature?

How to do this assignment: In your first paragraph, provide an opening topic sentence. Define the overall issue in the first paragraph. Tell your reader what the crux of the argument is. In other words, as you did before, can you boil down the overarching argument that encompasses all the readings into a few short sentences?

Next, decide how to structure the rest of the essay. Usually, presenting the various issues in order of importance is a useful strategy. Present the authors' views as if they could talk to each other. This will allow the reader to understand how the debate unfolds. Attribute all facts and opinions to the authors as you write. Using the last name in parenthesis for example (EPA) is sufficient documentation.

Finally, work on a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented in the debate and tell the reader what next steps are necessary/likely. Also, here you can tell your reader what you think should be the next steps. What is missing or not addressed in the literature? What questions remain unanswered and what needs further investigation?

A note on your role in this writing:  
As mentioned above, this time feel free to weave your own questions into the summary as you write. Your own voice should be very much present in the final paragraph. Listen to how your written voice changes as you add your own ideas. Remember to attribute all facts and opinions to their proper sources.
